# Notes-App
- Very Basic Note App being used to Explore NodeJS and its Syntax
- Uses input arguements to execute commands
- Some basic JSON Manipulation
- Exploring some useful Node Modules: fs, Yargs, Chalk, etc.

## Still in Development Phase (Need to build out front end to display notes properly)
